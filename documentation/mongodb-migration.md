# Migration Strategy Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for migrating the Kitchensink application from H2 (relational) to MongoDB (document-oriented).

## Data Migration Approach

### 1. Preparation Phase
- Set up a MongoDB instance (local, Atlas, or self-managed)
- Create required database and collections
- Apply schema validation rules to the collections
- Create necessary indexes (unique index on email, etc.)

### 2. Data Extraction Process
- Create an extraction script to pull data from H2
- Implement a Java-based extractor using Spring JdbcTemplate or JPA
- Extract Member data into a neutral format (e.g., JSON files)

### 3. Data Transformation Process
- Convert relational data structures to document structures
- Transform ID fields from Long to ObjectId
- Add timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) for existing records
- Validate data against MongoDB schema requirements
- Handle any data format inconsistencies

### 4. Data Loading Process
- Implement a MongoDB loader using Spring Data MongoDB
- Load transformed data into MongoDB
- Verify record counts match between source and target
- Validate unique constraints are preserved

### 5. Verification Steps
- Conduct count verification between H2 and MongoDB
- Perform data consistency checks between systems
- Validate all business rules and constraints
- Run sample queries to verify data accessibility

## Migration Execution

### Development Environment
1. Implement and test migration scripts in dev environment
2. Perform a full dry-run migration
3. Validate application functionality with MongoDB

### Staging Environment
1. Execute migration in staging environment
2. Verify data integrity and application functionality
3. Perform load/performance testing with MongoDB

### Production Environment
1. Schedule maintenance window
2. Back up existing H2 database
3. Execute migration scripts
4. Switch application configuration to MongoDB
5. Verify system functionality
6. Monitor system performance

## Rollback Procedure

### Triggering Criteria
- Data inconsistency detected
- Critical system functionality failure
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable levels

### Rollback Steps
1. Revert configuration to use H2 database
2. Restart application services
3. Verify system functionality with H2
4. Plan for re-migration after addressing issues

## Timeline
- Preparation & Development: 2 weeks
- Testing in Dev/QA: 1 week
- Staging Deployment & Testing: 1 week
- Production Migration: Scheduled maintenance window

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Integrity Issues**
   - Mitigation: Thorough validation steps, checksums
   - Contingency: Maintain backup of H2 data

2. **Performance Concerns**
   - Mitigation: Performance testing prior to production
   - Contingency: Optimize indexes and query patterns

3. **Application Incompatibility**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with MongoDB
   - Contingency: Address application code issues before migration

4. **Extended Downtime**
   - Mitigation: Thoroughly tested migration scripts
   - Contingency: Scheduled maintenance window with buffer time

## Success Criteria
- All data migrated with 100% integrity
- Application fully functional with MongoDB
- Performance meets or exceeds previous metrics
- No data loss or corruption
